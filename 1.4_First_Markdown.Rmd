# My First Markdown Title

## What is markdown? What are code blocks?

Markdown documents allow us to write a mixture of text (headers and body text) and R code, then 'knit' the document together into some kind of easily shared file (e.g. HTML, PDF, etc.). I like to use markdown documents whenever I am collaborating with colleagues, as it's much easier to share an HTML file instead of R script files. Very few people like to receive R script files!

Below is a code block, in which we will write R (or Python!) code. We can choose whether or not to display this code block in the final product with the 'echo' option.

```{r setup_block, include = F}

# Note: the 'include = F' above means we don't want to see ANY result of this code block.
# It still runs, but we don't care to see any warnings, results, etc.
# This is a nice way to keep the resulting document a readable length, and tidy.
library(tidyverse)
library(rayshader)
```


```{r, include = T, echo = T}
# Setting up some fake variables.
var_1 = c(1,2,3)
var_2 = c(5,5,10)

# Doing some wacky math.
my_results = var_1 * var_2

# When we call an object, or a model, or a plot, its output will be added to our markdown document.
my_results
```

## What can I include in a Markdown doc?

### Tables

```{r, warning=F}
my_table = iris |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  sample_n(10)

knitr::kable(my_table)
```

### Images

```{r}
# If the image is on our local machine, we can include it this way:
```

![Caption for our image. Hooonk!](data/Mirounga_angustirostris_calling_1_edit.jpg)

```{r}
# If the image is on the internet, we can include it with knitr::include_graphics.
knitr::include_graphics('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Seal-tortie.jpg')
```


### Tabsets {.tabset}

#### Tab A

```{r tab_a_content, echo = F}
mtcars |> 
  mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl)) |> 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = cyl, y = mpg, group = cyl)) + 
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Tab B

```{r tab_b_content, echo = F}
volcano %>%
  sphere_shade(texture = "desert") %>%
  # add_water(detect_water(volcano), color = "desert") %>%
  add_shadow(ray_shade(volcano, zscale = 10), 0.5) %>%
  add_shadow(ambient_shade(volcano), 0) %>%
  rayshader::plot_3d(volcano, zscale = 3, fov = 0, theta = 135, zoom = 0.75, phi = 45, windowsize = c(1000, 800))
rgl::rglwidget()
```
